      "More than 100,000 individuals in the U.S. suffer from sickle cell disease—an enduring and often invisible condition. The disease disproportionately affects individuals of African descent, many of whom rely on routine blood transfusions as an essential treatment to prevent life-threatening complications. In fact, a single patient with sickle cell disease can require thousands of blood transfusions throughout their lifetime. Your contribution can help us support those in need and create awareness for this vital cause.",
